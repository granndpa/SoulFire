## 🖥 Installation

> [!TIP]
> Want to check out how SoulFire looks before installing it? Take a look at the official [demo page](https://demo.soulfiremc.com).

Follow the [installation guide](https://soulfiremc.com/docs/installation) to install SoulFire.

The server bundles a headless Vulkan runtime and Mesa lavapipe for CPU rendering. No system Vulkan packages or display server are required.
Installed compatible GPU drivers provide hardware acceleration. See [native runtime packaging](docs/vulkan-runtime.md) for supported platforms and build instructions.
The Docker image includes lavapipe. On Debian or Ubuntu, install `libvulkan1` and `mesa-vulkan-drivers` when running without a GPU driver.
POV captures and inventory images render on demand without a native window. OpenGL is disabled.
See [renderer validation](docs/lavapipe-test.md) for the manual comparison tests.
